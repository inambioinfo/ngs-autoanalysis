This is a configuration file for logrotate to rotate the logs
from autoanalysis. Since we don't have root access on the sol
servers, this cannot be placed in /etc/logrotate.d to run
automatically. Instead, add a task to cron as "solexa" with
the following:

### Log rotation of auto analysis logs.
59 23 * * * /usr/sbin/logrotate -s /processing/Logs/.logrotate.status /home/mib-cri/svn_checkouts/autoanalysis_v1.6/logrotate/logrotate.conf > /dev/null 2>&1

This needs to be done on all machines.

The rotation needs to happen before the autoanalysis script
wakes up every 20 minutes.
